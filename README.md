# Future-Contraceptive-Use
An intelligent forecasting challenge that entails modelling future contraceptive use in Cote d'Ivoire.

Project Description
Greater access to contraceptives enables couples and individuals to determine whether, when, and how often to have children. Contraceptive access is vital to safe motherhood, healthy families, and prosperous communities.

In low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) around the world, health systems are often unable to accurately predict the quantity of contraceptives necessary for each health service delivery site, in part due to insufficient data, limited staff capacity, and inadequate systems.

When too few supplies are ordered, service delivery sites may run out, limiting access to contraceptives and family planning. When too much product is ordered, it leads to unused contraceptives that are wasted if they are left to expire.

Accurate forecasting of contraceptive consumption can save lives, money, and time by ensuring health service delivery sites have what they need when they need it and by reducing waste in the supply chain.

Objective: The goal of the Intelligent Forecasting is to predict consumption (stock_distributed in the Primary Data Dictionary) for 11 contraceptives across 156 health service delivery sites in the public sector health system in Côte d’Ivoire. The predictions should be made monthly for three months: October 2019, November 2019, and December 2019, using the dataset provided.

Dataset Description
You will have access to 42 months, January 2016 through June 2019, of data. The featured dataset is an extract from the electronic logistics management information system (eLMIS) used in Côte d’Ivoire to manage contraceptives and other health products across the country’s public health system.
